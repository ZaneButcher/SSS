<!-- Thsi is my first project currently only using html and css-->

<p>I and my wife work within the NHS so the inspiration for the website was to make life easier searching for information on staff training (whats in/not in date),
  how to log incidents via a datex system and to have all staff contact details in a handy table view format (I would like this to be a sytem that works in alphabetical order)
  but my skills are some way off XD! <p>
